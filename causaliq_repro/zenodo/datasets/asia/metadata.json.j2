{% set description -%}
This deposit contains the <i>Asia</i> Bayesian Network (BN) definitions and some
synthetic datasets generated using the network. The Asia BN is a well-known
benchmark model in probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian network research.
It is widely used for testing algorithms in structure learning, inference,
and causal discovery.

<h5><strong>Contents</strong></h5>

<ul>
<li>The Asia Bayesian Network definition in <code>.dsc</code> and 
<code>.xdsl</code> format</li>
<li>Synthetic datasets generated from the network with 100,000
and 10,000,000 rows</li>
<li>Supporting metadata and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Applications</strong></h5>
This resource is intended for researchers, educators, and practitioners 
working in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, 
and causal inference. Additionally, the CausalIQ software automatically uses 
this dataset to reproduce results in the CausalIQ papers.

<h5><strong>References</strong></h5>
<p>The Asia Bayesian Network was first introduced by Lauritzen and
Spiegelhalter (1988).</p>
