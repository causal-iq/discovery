## CausalIQ: Asia Bayesian Network Definition and Synthetic Datasets

### Overview
This repository contains the Asia Bayesian Network (BN) definitions and 
synthetic datasets generated using the network.
The Asia BN is a benchmark model in Bayesian network research, 
representing a hypothetical scenario involving lung cancer, 
tuberculosis, and related symptoms.

### Contents
The deposit includes the following:
1. **Network Definitions**:
   - `asia.dsc`: Network definition in DSC format
   - `asia.xdsl`: Network definition in XDSL format (compatible with GeNIe/SMILE).
2. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - `asia_100k.csv.gz`: Dataset with 100,000 rows.
   - `asia_10m.csv.gz`: Dataset with 10,000,000 rows.
3. **Documentation**:
   - This `README.md` file.

### Usage
1. **Network Definitions**:
   - Open the `.xdsl` file in GeNIe/SMILE for visualization and editing.
   - Use the `.dsc` with other Bayesian network tools.
2. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - Load the `.csv` files into your preferred data analysis tool 
     (e.g., Python, R, Excel).
   - Use the datasets for testing structure learning, inference,
     or causal discovery algorithms.
3. **CausalIQ Reproducibility Framework**
   - The CausalIQ reproducibility framework will automatically download the
     network definitions and sample datasets from this deposit as required
     to reproduce results, tables and figures used in CausalIQ papers.
