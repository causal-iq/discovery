# CausalIQ Reproducibility Entry Point

This Zenodo deposit is the main entry point for all digital assets required to reproduce the results of the CausalIQ project and its associated papers.

## Structure

- **Data:**  
  A curated list of all network definitions and datasets used in CausalIQ experiments, with links to their respective Zenodo deposits.

- **Structure Learning Results:**  
  This the entry point to all the structure learning results described in the CausalIQ papers. 
  The results are organised first by deposits defining the structure learning algorithm used, and then into _series_ which define the hyperparameters,
  sample sizes and randomisation, and networks used for each set of results reported.
  
  **Papers:**  
  References and links to all published papers including their tables and figures.
