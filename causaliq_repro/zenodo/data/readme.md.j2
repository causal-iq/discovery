## Structure

- **Datasets:**  
  The Related Links provide links to all datasets used in the CausalIQ project.

## How to Use

1. The CausalIQ software automatically downloads the relevant datasets referenced in this deposit to reproduce results and hence tables and figures in the CausalIQ papers.
2. Each dataset is maintained as a separate Zenodo deposit and provides a definition of the Bayesian Network and synthetic datasets generated from that definition.
