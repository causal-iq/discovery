# CausalIQ: Causal Discovery Research

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This repository is under active restructuring. Expect significant changes.**

This repository hosts the code and reproducibility infrastructure behind a series of academic papers on **Bayesian Network structure learning**, developed by [Ken Kitson](https://github.com/KenKitson) and collaborators.

It includes:
- New **structure learning algorithms** (e.g., Tabu-Stable)
- Tools for evaluating **accuracy** and **stability**
- Integration of **human expertise** in causal discovery
- A framework for **reproducing published figures and results**

---
    
## üì¶ Project Goals

- Provide an installable Python package of reusable algorithms (`causaliq/`)
- Provide an installable Python package implementing a pipleine (`causaliq_pipeline/`) to run causaliq and other structure learning algorithms and analyse the results
- Offer a reproducibility framework for datasets, experiments, figures, and tables from papers which downloads large files and other assets from Zenodo

---

## üîÅ Reproducibility Workflow (Coming Soon)

You can reproduce figures and tables from supported papers using the `repro.py` script with the following arguments:

```bash
python repro.py <operation> <target> [--run]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<operation>` (positional): defines what te script will do, one of:
  - `learn` - performs all required structure learnng and analysis to generate asset
  - `analyse` - downloads structure learning results but performs analysis to generate analysis
  - `download` - downloads required results and asset
- `<target>` (positional): Path to the asset to reproduce (e.g., `papers/ijar_stable/fig1`)
- `--run`: Actually perform the operation (omit for a dry run with time estimates)
- `--help`: Show usage instructions

**Examples:**

- Dry run (shows what structure learning and analysis would be done to reproduce fig1 of paper ijar_stable):  
  `python repro.py learn papers/ijar_stable/fig1`
- Actually download structure learning results, but rerun analysis locally for tab2:  
  `python repro.py analyse papers/ijar_stable/tab2 --run`
- Just download results and selected assets from Zenodo:  
  `python repro.py download papers/ijar_stable/fig1`

## üîß Using the Algorithms (planned)

Once packaged, install with:

```bash
pip install causaliq
```

Use in your own code (COMING SOON), this is a possble example:

```python
from causaliq.learning import tabustable
G = tabustable.learn_structure(df, score="bic", tabu_length=15)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up R and bnlearn

Many of the papers in this project compare structure learning algorithms, including those implemented in the R package `bnlearn`. To use these algorithms, you need to set up R and `bnlearn` in your environment.

### Steps to Set Up R and bnlearn

1. **Install R**:
   - Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   - Ensure you install a version compatible with `bnlearn` (e.g., R 4.5.1).

2. **Install the `bnlearn` Package**:
   - Open an R console and run the following command:
     ```R
     install.packages("bnlearn")
     ```

3. **Set the `CAUSALIQ_R_SCRIPT` Environment Variable**:
   - Locate the `Rscript` executable. This is typically found in the `bin` directory of your R installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.1\bin\Rscript.exe` on Windows).
   - Set the `CAUSALIQ_R_SCRIPT` environment variable to the full path of the `Rscript` executable. For example:
     - On **Windows**:
       ```powershell
       $env:CAUSALIQ_R_SCRIPT="C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.1\bin\Rscript.exe"
       ```
     - On **Linux/Mac** (add to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):
       ```bash
       export CAUSALIQ_R_SCRIPT="/usr/local/bin/Rscript"
       ```

4. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal to ensure `Rscript` is accessible:
     ```bash
     $env:CAUSALIQ_R_SCRIPT --version
     ```
   - Ensure the `bnlearn` package is installed by running:
     ```R
     library(bnlearn)
     ```

By following these steps, you will be able to use the R-based structure learning algorithms in this project.
